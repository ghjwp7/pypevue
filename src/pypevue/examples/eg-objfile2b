Example: Read a file with a subset of Wavefront .obj codes,
and draw sets of faces, several ways.   jiw 11 Oct 2020

Note, when obfile is 'slabs.obj', the resulting OpenSCAD code will
display ok via F5, but will fail to render via F6 due to CGAL errors
re improperly-incident faces.  Other non-manifold OBJ files may fail
for other reasons.

=P Plugins=examples.objReader2

=A obFiles = ('slabs.obj', 'cottage_obj.obj', 'cow-nonormals.obj')
== Select filename by obFiles subscript.
=A obfile = obFiles[2]

=A allCalls = ([(ref.objOnePoly, obfile, 1)],   [(ref.objFatPoly, obfile, 2)],   [(ref.objFatPoly, obfile, 3), (ref.objManyPoly, obfile, 2)],   [(ref.objFatPoly, obfile, 3), (ref.objManyPoly, obfile, 2), (ref.objOnePoly, obfile, 1)])

== Select which methods get used, by allCalls subscript:
==   allCalls[0] for objOnePoly at scale 1
==   allCalls[1] for objFatPoly at scale 2
==   allCalls[2] for objFatPoly at scale 3 + objManyPoly at scale 2
==   allCalls[3] for objFatPoly, objManyPoly, objOnePoly at scales 3, 2, 1
