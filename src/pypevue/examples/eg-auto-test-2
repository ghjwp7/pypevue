An example file to demonstrate automatically making edges (cylinders)
between posts that are within specified cutoff distance of each other.
See autoAdder1c.py for a description of the algorithm used, and a
little more about parameters that control it.  jiw 15 Oct 2020

Note: In this example, generated points may superficially resemble a
geodesic arrangement.  However, the arbitrarily selected polygon radii
and z heights that are used don't give a real geodesic arrangement.

In parameter settings, userPar0 and userPar1 values are a sphere-size
and a cube-size, respectively, within the SCAD code that's included
because of parameter userCode=eg-auto-help-2.scad.  In OpenSCAD, you
can use the Customizer panel to change userPar values, then press
Enter or F5.

zSpread=t turns on a conformal transform to give triangles on the
outskirts of a hemisphere more screen area, for easier viewing.  It
maps point (x,y,z) to (c*x,c*y,z) where c = 2/(1+z/zSize).  This can
broaden or flatten the sides of the hemisphere, displaying like a cone
with a rounded top.  Larger zSize decreases the broadening effect.
Here, with zSize=6, the outer polygons are narrower than if zSize were
equal to the radius 4.

Other parameters used here: postAxial=f makes the posts point at
OP. OP is given by O entry in the layout section.  postLabel=cMu makes
labels at level c, magenta, size u.  autoList=f suppresses listing of
auto-generated edges.  autoMax=227 sets upper bound on lengths of
auto-generated edges.  The `Plugins=` entries tell which python code
files to plug in to pypeVue for special processing.
