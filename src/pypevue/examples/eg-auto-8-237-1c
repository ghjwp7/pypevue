An example file to demonstrate automatically making edges (cylinders)
between posts that are within specified cutoff distance of each other.
See autoAdder1c.py for a description of the algorithm used, and a
little more about parameters that control it.  See eg-auto-test-2 and
pypevu.dox (odt or pdf) for descriptions of other parameters
below.  jiw 15 Oct 2020
